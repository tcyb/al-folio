I am a physician-scientist interested in computational and informatics approaches to medicine, in particular investigating the temporal dynamics of complex, multidimensional systems. Formerly of <a href="http://web.mit.edu/sharplab/">Sharp Lab</a> at MIT, and <a href="http://kordinglab.com/">Kording Lab</a> and <a href="https://tyolab.northwestern.edu/">Tyo Lab</a> at Northwestern University.

I am currently an internal medicine resident at Northwestern's McGaw Medical Center, and a member of their <a href="https://www.medicine.northwestern.edu/education/residents/about/training-programs/pstp.html">Physician Scientist Training Program</a> with an intended fellowship in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine.
